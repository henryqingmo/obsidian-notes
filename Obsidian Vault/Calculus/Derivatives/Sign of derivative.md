### Idea
#### Definition 5.5.1
Suppose that a function f is defined on an interval I. We say that

a) f is increasing on $I$ if for every two points $x_1$ and $x_2$ in $I$, $x_1 < x_2$ implies that $f(x_1) < f(x_2)$;

b) f is decreasing on $I$ if for every two points $x_1$ and $x_2$ in $I$, $x1 < x2$ implies that $f(x_1) > f(x_2)$.
