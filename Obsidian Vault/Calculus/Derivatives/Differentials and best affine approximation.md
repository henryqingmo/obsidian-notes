### Idea

#### Single-variable
Using [[Tangent and normal|tangent]] line to approximate a nearby point

any single-variable function can be "zoomed-in" to be approximated with a linear function. This is the idea behind differentiation.

The derivative is exactly the scaling factor of the [[Affine transformation]]
#### Differential
![[IMG_0555.jpeg]]
The differential represents the change in output, as the result of a tiny change in the input space.  They are exactly the same as linear approximation.

The differential can also be though of as a [[Directional derivative]], the rate of change of $f$ in the direction of $dx$
Note that the notation is **flipped** here as it's a notation from differential geometry.

#### Multi-variable case

### Formally
#### Using [[Linear Algebra/Vectors and Spaces/Triangle inequality]], the upper bound for the error($\Delta F$) is
