### Idea

Here d represent distance, which is measure by [[Metric]].

### Analogy
![[2. Elementary Analysis - Handout.pdf#page=8]]
Basically, no matter how small a radius $\epsilon > 0$ you choose, there will be an index $K$ such that for all $k > K$, the term $x_k$ will always be inside the ball of centred at L.

The negation will be, no matter what point L you try to pick, it's not an limit, or in other words, no matter how far the sequence gets, there will be points outside the radius if you shrink the radius to some degree.   
#### Example
In an convergence example, it is important to highlight $K$ has to grow as $\epsilon$ decreases, this is because of [[Limit definition]], as $\epsilon$ goes to 0, $K$ must go to infinity.

If we try to proof the negation, we find $\epsilon$ in dependant on $k$, this is not allowed because k is after $\epsilon$ by definition, $\epsilon$ can however dependent on the limit we chose.
