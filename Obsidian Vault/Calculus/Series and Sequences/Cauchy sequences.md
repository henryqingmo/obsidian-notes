### Idea
All [[Convergent sequence]] are Cauchy
![[2. Elementary Analysis - Handout.pdf#page=12]]
 We know that $\textbf{x}_k$ is convergent, so $d(\textbf{x}_{k}, \textbf{x})$ is less than any number that's greater than 0, and similarly for $d(\textbf{x}_j, \textbf{x})$ as both of them satisfy $j, k > K$. We choose those number to be $\frac{\epsilon}{2}$ Q.E.D
