- IFT â‰ˆ can we project the surface smoothly onto the x,y plane as a function z=f(x,y)
    
- **Fails** when:
    
    - Surface has vertical tangents (e.g., tangent plane is horizontal),
        
    - Surface folds over (multiple z value for one (x, y).

The sphere fails IFT because it has multiple z-value for some (x,y) point.
The saddle satisfy IFT.
