Gradient operator converts a scalar field into a [[Vector field]].

The x components represent the x-direction of greatest ascent, so together the gradient vector points towards the greatest ascent.  

We can verify this with [[Directional derivative]],  the max of $\nabla f \cdot \hat u$ is when [[Dot product]] has angle of 0, then the slope would be $|\nabla f|$, so intuitively going up the $\nabla f$ direction has the greatest slope.
