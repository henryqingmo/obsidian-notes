This indicates the order which the partial derivative exist and continuous. 
This is equivalent as saying the [[Gradient]] exists and continuous, because this implies all the [[Directional derivative]] exists and continuous as they are the it's [[Projection]].

If $K\ge 2$ then the [[Hessian Matrix]] is symmetrical.
