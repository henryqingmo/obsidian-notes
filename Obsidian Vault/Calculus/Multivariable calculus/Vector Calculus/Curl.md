Converts a vector field into a vector field.

#### Connections to flow integral

Curl is defined precisely as the [[Flow and flux integral]] divided by the area of the region, as the region approaches a point.

Mathematically the shape can be represented with a square since it gets arbitrarily small. 

We can group the [[Line integral over vector field]] on opposite directions and arrive exactly the sum of the flow from x and y. 
#### Visually

We can see that it's the difference across vectors on opposite sites thats contributing to the field. 

So we have exactly the difference on those vector over the width x.

By similar argument, for arrived at the formula for y, except this time the anticlockwise direction requires negative vector on positive y, therefore we add a negative sign. 
#### Connection to [[Cross product]]
