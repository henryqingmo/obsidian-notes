Gradient operator converts a scalar field into a [[Vector field]].

For a implicit function like a hyperplane in [[Vector space]]
[[Implicit function theorem]]

The x components represent the x-direction of greatest ascent, so together the gradient vector points towards the greatest ascent.  

We can verify this with [[Directional derivative]],  the max of $\nabla f \cdot \hat u$ is when [[Dot product]] has angle of 0, then the slope would be $|\nabla f|$, so intuitively going up the $\nabla f$ direction has the greatest slope.

For an explicit function  like $f(x,y,z) = c$ , the gradient represent [[Tangent and normal]] of the surface. 
And the implicit gradient is the [[Projection]] of the explicit gradient.

This is why we can't take gradient of both sides for a level curve. 
Because the gradient contains the information from a higher dimension projected onto this lower dimension.
