###  Intuition
![[Pasted image 20250324235801.png]]
On the left we have the sum of the surface area multiply by each rectangle of subdivision of y, the surface area corresponds to the height on the right.

This is similar if we first find the surface area in cross-section of x, and then integrate along the x-axis.  Both will arrive at the the volume under the surface. 


### Formally
Here we need to rewrite [[Double integral]] with the [[Riemann integral]].
