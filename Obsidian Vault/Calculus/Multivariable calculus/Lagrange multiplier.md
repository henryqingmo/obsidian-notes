Finding the maximum of $f$ on some constraint of a level curve of $g$ 
The constraint will have 2D [[Gradient]] vector that's perpendicular to it's tangent line, pointing at the greatest ascend.

Think of it like the level-curve is the cross-section, so z is constant along the curve, that means there's downward gravity force pushing it along the traversal, the only possible force on it is therefore perpendicular to the tangent.

Similarly, the function $f$ can only travel along it's constraint, but at it's extrema, it has to be a [[Stationary points(Multi-variable)]],  (*Assuming there's no boundary point for the constraint which is implied by the $C^1$*  one example is a line segment).

Think of it like we know the it's the lowest point along the traversal curve, so the ball can only move down in the opposite direction to the direction of traversal, or itself can be the local minima, or a saddle point, which means it will not move and the gradient is 0.

We look at the extrema from level curve perspective, it's gradient vector is perpendicular to it's tangent(same as the constraint's tangent), and in the 2D case, this means it has to pointing at the same direction as the constraint's normal( **$\vec 0$ implies a locally constant function**).
