### Idea

![[11. Double and Triple Integrals - Annotated.pdf#page=29]]
Define a function that's 0 everywhere except the region we want to integrate.
![[11. Double and Triple Integrals - Annotated.pdf#page=30]]
### Intuition 
![[Pasted image 20250325105549.png]]
In rectangular region, we integrate along x-axis, or y-axis with bound of x and y as constants.  
![[Pasted image 20250325105829.png]]
In non-rectangular region, we now use functions as bounds, notice the  [[Fubini's Theorem]] applied is slightly different, as the bounds will change if we integrate. first in the other direction.
#### Important note 
 We are integrating **along** the direction we sweep through, which gives us a surface in 3D along our integrated direction.

If the function is 1, we find the area of the region, or equivalently the volume of a prism where the base is the region and has a height of 1.

### Example
![[11. Double and Triple Integrals - Annotated.pdf#page=32]]
![[11. Double and Triple Integrals - Annotated.pdf#page=33]]

### X-simple and y-Simple
![[11. Double and Triple Integrals - Annotated.pdf#page=38]]
y-simple or x-simple essentially means region can be bounded by **two** function of x or y. 
The direction of the sweep should be **parallel** to the variable we integrate against. 
y-simple, we integrate along **y**, bounding y with functions in terms of **x**.
