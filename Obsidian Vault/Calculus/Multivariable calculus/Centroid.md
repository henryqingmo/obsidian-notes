### Idea

We can partition the shape into small simple shape with known centroid, and sum them multiplied by their area proportioned to the total area. 
### Intuitively
![[Pasted image 20250405001136.png]]
This is similar to the torque physics,  where each region provides a downward weight depending on it's area.

Plotting the distribution, we can see that the centroid is exactly the [[Variance_and_Expected value.excalidraw]] of the distribution curve.

Another way is to think about the mean

Here we think of centroid as the Arithmetic mean.
