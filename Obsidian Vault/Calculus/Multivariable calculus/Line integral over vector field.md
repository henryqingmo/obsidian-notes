### Idea

Here $dr$ represents the length of the curve, which is equivalent to $c^{\prime}(t)$ as mentioned in [[Line integral over scalar field]]

Here $d\vec s$ is the same as $d \vec c$ [[Total differential approximation]]
We have the projection of the [[Vector field]] onto the tangent curve, multiplied by the length of the curve.

This is similar to the concept of work, where we accumulate the work done on every small segment.

#### This concept can also be represented with anti-derivative

Here we use [[Total differential approximation]]

#### Connection to Riemann integral 
[[Riemann integral]] can be directly translated to line integral over vector field.

Since it's a dot product, the direction of traversal does matters.
