On the left we have a closed [[Line integral over vector field]], on the right we have [[Double integral]] of the [[Curl]]

The line integral measures the work done along the curve, or the amount of "water" tends to circulate the curve. 

The double integral sums up the curl in each partition of the region inside the curve. 
#### Visually

We can partitioned the curve into small rectangles, with each rectangle associated with a closed line integral, their edges will eventually cancel out giving a total of the outer [[Line integral over vector field]]. 

When we make the rectangle infinitely small, it's exactly equal to the [[Curl]] at each point.
### Formally

The idea of  curl as [[Flow and flux integral]] is discussed here [[Curl]]
Here we demonstrates the curl is approximately the line integral of the rectangle.

Then by summing the rectangles, we reached our conclusion.
