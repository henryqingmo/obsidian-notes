### Idea
#### [[Taylor series]] in $\mathbb{R}$
![[8. Taylor Polynomials - Handout.pdf#page=12]]
#### Degree 2 Taylor polynomial
![[8. Taylor Polynomials - Handout.pdf#page=13]]
We have $f_{xx}(a, b) + f_{yy}(a, b)$ equivalent to represent curvature along x and y, and a mixed curvature term $f_{xy}$ or $f_{yx}$ that accounts for interactions between x and y.

Which we can express with the [[Hessian Matrix]].
