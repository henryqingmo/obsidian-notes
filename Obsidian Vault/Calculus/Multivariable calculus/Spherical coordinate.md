All 3D points can be expressed into spherical coordinates. 
Here $\rho$ represents the radius, $\theta$ is the angle from positive x-axis to positive y-axis, $\phi$ measures the angle from positive z-axis  to the x-y plane.

$\theta$ goes from $0$ to $2\pi$, which sweep through the x-y plane
![[12. Change of Variable - Annotated.pdf#page=28]]
$\phi$ goes from 0 (vertical line on positive z) to $\frac{\pi}{2}$, the equator all the way to $\pi$ the vertical line on negative z.

$x^2 = y^2 = az^2$ would look like a hourglass shape.

$(x,y)$ is exactly $(r\cos\theta, r\sin\theta)$ where $r = \rho\sin\phi$
