### Idea
#### Flow integral 
![[Pasted image 20250411004608.png]]
Flow measures the degree which the path aligns with the vector field, or the tendency the water to flow along the curve. 

This is exactly [[Line integral over vector field]] but interpreted differently.

The circulation is the closed line integral, which is 0 in a conservative [[Vector field]].

Here instead we measure the water going out.

We can calculate the normal by defining a [[Cross product]] in 3d

Here we used [[Green theorem]] to express flux in terms of [[Divergence]]
