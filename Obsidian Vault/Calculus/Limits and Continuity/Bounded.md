### Idea
#### Definition 3.4.8
A function f is said to be bounded on an interval I if there is some positive number M such that $|f(x)| \leq M$ for all x in I.

#### Corollary 3.4.9
If $f : [a, b] \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous on $[a, b]$ then $f$ is bounded on $[a, b].$
### Formally
#### Prove of 3.4.9
Suppose that f is continuous on $[a,b]$. Then the function $|f|$ is also continuous on $[a,b]$
By the [[Maximum-Minimum Theorem]], $|f|$ attains its maximum on $[a,b]$. If $M$ denotes the absolute maximum value of $|f|$ on $[a,b]$, then 
$$
|f(x)|  <= M \; \forall x \in [a,b]. 
$$Hence $f$ is bounded.
