### Idea
#### Definition 3.2.2
Suppose that f is a real-valued function defined on a closed interval $[a, b]$. We say that
f is continuous at the endpoint a if $\lim\limits_{x\to a^{+}}f(x)= f(a)$

f is continuous at the endpoint b if $\lim\limits_{x\to b^{-}}f(x)= f(b)$

f is continuous on the closed interval $[a,b]$ if f is continuous on the open interval $(a, b)$ and at each of the endpoints $a$ and $b$.
