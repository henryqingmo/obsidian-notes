### Idea
### Definition 2.5.1
If the left hand limit and right hand limit both exist and equal to the same number L, then the limit at that point equal to L.

This is using the idea of [[Limit at a point]], it's saying the point is the limit point for all sequences in the set in $\Omega$, since the limit point is exactly the interior points and the boundary points, it's all of them converges is exactly the same as limits at a point.
