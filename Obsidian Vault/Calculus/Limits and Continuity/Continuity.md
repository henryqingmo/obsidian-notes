### Idea
#### Definition 2.5.3.

Suppose that f is defined on some open interval containing the point a. If $\lim_\limits{x \to a} f(x) = f(a)$, then we say that f is continuous at a; otherwise, we say that f is discontinuous at a. 

#### Definition 2.5.4
If $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous at every point a in $\mathbb{R}$ then we say that $f$ is continuous everywhere.

#### Theorem 4.5.1
If $f$ is differentiable at $a$ then $f$ is continuous at $a$.
Using contra-positive: 
If $f$ is not continuous at $a$ then it is not differentiable at $a$.

Linear combination of continuous function is also continuous
