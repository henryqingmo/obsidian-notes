#### Intuitively 
Think of |f(x) - L| as an graph of distance that's below epsilon that approach 0 as x goes to infinity.

When we find the upper bound, we are essentially looking for a simple function that's above our distance function, but is bounded by epsilon. Hence by the [[Pinching theorem]], we conclude the limit exist.
