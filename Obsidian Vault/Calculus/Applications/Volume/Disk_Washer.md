## Disk is a circle with radius of the function respect to the rotation axis

## To find the volume find the area of each add them up
$$ \pi\int_a^b f(x)^2 \;dx $$

## Washer is a hollow circle created when area enclosed by 2 curves
## To find the volume, find the larger radius (far away from the axis) and the smaller radius (nearest from the rotation axis) 
$$ \pi \int_a^b f(x)^2 - g(x)^2 \; dx $$
