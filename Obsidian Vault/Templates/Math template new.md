## 📐 Definition

<!-- Start with the formal definition -->
- Let \( f: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m \) ...
- Define all variables and notation clearly.

---

## 🖼️ Visual / Representation

<!-- Include a diagram, geometric intuition, or symbolic representation -->
> Optionally add a quick drawing or link to an image.
- Use this section to “see” what the object or concept is doing.
- Try describing it in words too, like:  
  “A Jacobian is a matrix of partial derivatives.”

---

## 🧠 Intuition

<!-- Explain what this concept means and why it's useful -->
- What does this represent conceptually?
- Where does it show up in applications?
- Analogy, metaphor, or simplified example

---

## 🧾 Derivation / Proof (Optional)

<!-- Sketch the proof or show where the formula comes from -->
- Use steps or LaTeX
- You can collapse long proofs with `%%` or Obsidian’s folding

---

## 🧮 Example(s)

<!-- Concrete worked-out examples -->
- Walk through step-by-step.
- Use LaTeX for equations.
- Visual if applicable.

## 🧰 Applications

<!-- Where is this used in real life? -->
- Machine learning: e.g. Jacobians in backprop
- Robotics: e.g. velocity kinematics
- Optimization: Newton’s method with Jacobian
