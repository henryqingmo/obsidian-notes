### Idea
#### Degree of vertex and edge
For any graph or multigraph, the sum of the degrees of all the vertices in G equals 
twice the number of edges in G. 

	Every vertex degree sequence whose sum is even has a corresponding multigraph
	but not nesscessary a graph. 
#### Degree of region and edge
For any graph or multigraph, the sum of the degrees of all the regions in G equals 
twice the number of edges in G. 

### Formally
$$
\sum_{v \in V(G)}deg(v) = 2|E(G)|
$$
$$
\sum_{regions\;R}deg(R) = 2|E(G)|
$$### Proof

	Each edge is counted twice because it has two endpoints. 
	Similarly for regions.
