### Idea
#### Multigraph
There can be more than 1 distinct edges in a multigraph and 
there can be a loop which has exactly 1 end point.
![[Topic 5 Lecture Notes (Gardiner).pdf#page=6]]
#### Graph
A simple multigraph or graph is a multigraph without loop and parallel edges. 
#### Directed Graph
A directed graph has edges in ordered pair of distinct vertices. 
### Formally

endpoint function for multigraph
$$
E(G) \rightarrow P(V(G))
$$
endpoint function for directed multigraph
$$
E(G) \rightarrow V(G) \times V(G)
$$
