### Idea

For the non-disjoint case, we have 
```handwritten-ink
{
	"versionAtEmbed": "0.2.6",
	"filepath": "Assets/Pictures/Ink/Writing/2024.12.2 - 19.02pm.writing"
}
```

```handwritten-ink
{
	"versionAtEmbed": "0.2.6",
	": "Assets/Pictures/Ink/Writing/2024.12.2 - 19.00pm.writing"
}
```

#### Proof
```handwritten-ink
{
	"versionAtEmbed": "0.1.19",
	"filepath": "Assets/Pictures/Ink/Writing/2024.7.9 - 15.11pm.writing"
}
```
If A and B are independent, the definition is $P(A | B) = P(A)$ and $P(B|A) = P(B)$, which means that $P(A\cap B) = P(A)P(B)$. This is different to disjoint.

Discuss pre and post testing.
