The idea is we need to find the radius for the small ball, such that it fits into the large ball. This radius would exactly be on the radius connecting the point we choose, because the shortest distance from the point to the boundary of the circle is exactly on that line(orthogonal to the tangent of the circle), which is the amount we can sweep out that's still inside the ball.
