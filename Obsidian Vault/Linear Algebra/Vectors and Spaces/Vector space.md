### Idea

#### Vector space is a special type of hyperplane that passes through the origin. 
Vector space has to be homogenous so that solutions contains the origin, and ensures closure.

#### Subspace
Subset is any set of vector within the vector space.
Since the subset is already within a vector space, we only need to verify the subspace theorem.

#### Alternate subspace test
replace ii) and iii) with $\lambda v + w \in \mathbb{S} \;\; \forall \; v, w \in S \;\; \text{and} \;\; \lambda \in \mathbb{F}$
#### Column Space

$$
A\vec{x} = x_{1}\pmatrix{a_{11}\\a_{21} \\\vdots \\a_{m1}} +  x_{2}\pmatrix{a_{12}\\a_{22} \\\vdots \\a_{m2}}  \dots  + x_{n}\pmatrix{a_{1n}\\a_{2n}\\ \vdots \\ a_{mn}}
$$
Hence it's called the column space

$\mathbb{R}^{3}$ is a vector space and $\mathbb{R}$ is a field.
### Example

Here we argument matrix with $\pmatrix{x\\y\\z}$ to find the possible b that so that there is a solution.
