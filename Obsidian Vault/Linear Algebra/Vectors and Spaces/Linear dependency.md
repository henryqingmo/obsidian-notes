A set S is linearly dependent if at least one vector in S is a linear combination of others; otherwise, it is independent.

For x1v1+x2v2+…+xnvn=0x_1v_1 + x_2v_2 + \ldots + x_nv_n = 0x1​v1​+x2​v2​+…+xn​vn​=0:

- Linearly dependent if non-zero solutions exist for xxx.
- Linearly independent if only the zero solution exists.
The row reduction preserves the linear dependency but destroys the span.
