1. Put the matrix in row-echelon form.
2. Check if there is a row without a leading column. 
3. if step 2 is true, then no solution 
4. count the number of leading columns
5. subtract that from the total columns
6.  0 represent a unique solution, 1 represent infinite solution with 1 variable and so on.
