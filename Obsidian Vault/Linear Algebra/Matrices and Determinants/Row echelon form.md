### Idea
Definition 2. A matrix is said to be in row-echelon form if
1. all leading rows are above all non-leading rows (so any all-zero rows are at the
bottom of the matrix), and
2. in every leading row, the leading entry is further to the right than the leading
entry in any row higher up in the matrix.

This means that the element below the pivot / leading entry is 0

Reduced echelon form

A matrix is said to be in reduced row-echelon form if it is in
row-echelon form and in addition
3. every leading entry is 1, and
4. every leading entry is the only non-zero entry in its column.
