### Idea
![[Steve Brunton - Complex Analysis L04 The Complex Logarithm, Log(z) [CpKD9aYEdms - 946x532 - 17m34s].png]]
There is unique z but infinite w for every Log(z), this is because z can take infinite angles. 

For the principal value, we want $\theta \in (-\pi, \pi]$, Hence we take $n = 0$
then  $Log(z) = log(|z|) + i\theta_{p}$

### Formally
The Multivalued log function

The Principal Branch 
![[Lect-13-Inverse-Exponential-fns-2018-beamer.pdf#page=14]]
Rewrite multivalued log in terms of principal branch
$$
log(z) = Log(z) + 2k\pi i
$$
#### Analytic
$$
Log(z) \;\; \text{is not analytic if z} \in (-\infty, 0]
$$
$$
Arg(z) \;\; \text{is not analytic if}\; z \in (-\infty, 0]
$$


Since the log function uses the Arg function, It has the same branch cut
at the negative real axis.  Hence it's not analytic on the negative real axis.
