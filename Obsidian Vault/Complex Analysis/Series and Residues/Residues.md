### Idea
[[Cauchy's Integral Formula]]
The $c_{-1}$ term is important because the integral becomes $C_{-1}\;log(z)$ of a full rotation, but the [[Complex Logarithm]] function goes up by $2\pi i$ in a spiral, the other terms vanishes, the positive powers vanishes due to [[Cauchy-Goursat Theorem]], the negative powers also goto 0.

For the removable [[Singularity]], by definition it has no negative power, therefore the coefficient of $\frac{1}{z-z_0}$  is 0.

After multiplying by $(z-z_0)^N$, the residue term is now $C_{-1}(z-z_0)^{N-1}$
If we differentiate it $N-1$ times, the power from $0$ to $N-2$ disappears, leaving $(N-1)C_{-1}$ 
as the constant term, we can them setting $z = z_0$ to eliminate other terms.

N here is the order of a pole [[Singularity]]
